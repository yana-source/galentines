  <h2>Dear Nanglam,</h2>
  
  <p>
    The first time I met you was at Eric's birthday party. I had no clue who you were. I remember that I knew everyone at the party except you. So I asked you about yourself, and when I asked you about your school and you answered, I was shocked: we were in the same school! I thought the only one at the party from the same school as me was Dominic. Then all of a sudden, I started noticing you more in school. I started speaking to you more, visiting Leonie and eventually seeing you more often (because she had such a fat crush on Dominic so she always ended up in your classroom). From then on, we've been more ride-or-die than I could ever dream of. <br><br>
There is not enough air in my lungs to express the magnitude of appreciation that I have for your existence. Never did I imagine we could become so close to each other, eating each other's lunch, playfighting half the time we saw each other, gossiping, ranting, sharing the most unfunny memes, and just spending time with each other. When we first met, I had no idea that you'd become this important to me. There's a term called a 'blue person', which can be defined as someone who came into your life when you needed someone the most. They simply change your perspective on life, they are someone you can always count on, someone that listens to you when you're not heard by others, a person that brings out the real you, someone your life wouldn't be the same without. I think it's safe to say you're my blue person. You offered me a fresh perspective whenever I needed it. When I was feeling stuck, you taught me to look at things from a new lens. I think it's nice to have someone that's aware of your sensitivity and learn to handle your feelings gently, with patience and care. It can be incredibly comforting to show your vulnerability to someone and have them know how to respond with understanding and thoughtfulness. The hours I spend with you go by the fastest, but they are the hours I look forward to the most. When I had my falling out with Leonie, you were realistically the only person I could lean on, mostly because you somewhere in the middle of both sides. And yet, you never once wavered. You showed up, supporting me and encouraging me that I was brave enough to let her go. Because when we're together, we're cooler than everyone else. You're one of the few persons I've met who seems to have the faintest conception of what I mean when I say a thing. I might be the writer in this moment, but you'll always be the words. You showed me one important thing that not many people have been able to show me before. Not that I'm pretty, not that I'm smart, not that I'm sweet. None of that. You showed me something more important than any of those things. You showed me that I was important, that there's a reason I'm here. You made me feel like the world was lucky to have me, and I don't know if any new person I'll meet will ever make me feel that way again. I think it wasn't fate, but intent, that our birthdays are so close, because if you came to me with a face I have not seen, with a voice I have never heard, I would still know you. Even if centuries separated us, I would still know you. Somewhere between the sand and the stardust, through every collapse and creation, there is a pulse that echoes of you and I. When we first stopped talking, I felt very void. There is nothing worse than losing someone who you connected with so quick. And when you came back into my life because of that stupid Ethics Bowl competition, I couldn't have been more grateful. If reincarnation is real, I want to be the stars if you're reincarnated as the moon. I want to be the peel if you're reincarnated as the pulp. I want to be the ja if you're reincarnated as the doh, because simply being with you feels like dancing in our happiest moments. Maybe I'm not good at understanding love. But I do know that I love the way the sun diffuses rays of yellow, orange, pink across the skyline as it sinks. I love the calm of a cool seaside breeze. I love the buzz of the night life in the city. Maybe I'm not good at understanding love. But I do know I love the way you laugh, the way you prank people or write silly letters to your admirers. I love the way you make me feel like I'm not so strange. I love your jagged imperfections and your 3 a.m. thoughts. I love the way you talk, I love your spark. Maybe I'm not very good at understanding love. But I do know that I love your light as much as I love your dark. I love everything that makes you who you are.<br><br>
After ten or twenty years from now, when we're both freely and genuinely happy with our own lives, I hope we'll see each other again. You can bring your kids or the person with whom you ended up facing the altar, and we can talk over coffee without feeling a lump in our throats. You can tell me how proud you are of all the things I've achieved, and I can tell you how happy I am that you finally found your peace. Although I don't think I'll be happily married to someone when that time comes - if I even marry. But I'll be travelling the world, taking pictures for memories, and trying out foods my tongue doesn't recognise. And we'll both remember those times we spent with each other, fooling around and being chaotic. I don't know how else to tell you what you mean to me. You happening to me was everything that this heart could have asked for.
<br><br>
Always + forever,<br>
Yana ❤︎
