  <h2>Dear Dasan,</h2>
  
  <p>
    We've been friends for barely a year, and yet the impact you've had in my life in such a short time is irreversible. I didn't even know who you were, or what you looked like. I just knew you as the kid who dated the Vice Principal's daughter.  And somehow, we've come so far. Knowing you and admiring you has been one of the easiest tasks, because it's not that often that you find such a gem of a friend, especially when you've not known them for long. But you redefined those boundaries. <br><br>
I believe that in a way, we are platonic soulmates. We were never meant to be romantic. We were just meant to be. Although the love we have for each other is undeniable, and although the love we have for each other exists, it was not meant to stretch beyond the pure unions of friendship. It was not meant to stretch at our heart strings, bur rather, it was meant to gently massage them into peace. It was not meant to stretch past the boundaries we subconsciously set to ensure that things don't become complicated. It was not meant to stretch our connection into emotional destinations that have no return ticket if we took that plunge. My love for you is pure, no motive or obligation attached to it. So is it so hard to believe that our paths were perfectly aligned to meet and we were placed in each other's lives even if it wasn't for a 'romantic' purpose? Is it so hard to fathom that a fondness can exist between two people whose only intention is pouring the love that exists between them back into a friendship? I don't think so. I seriously don't know what to write for a man, especially for a man like you, who is so nonchalant and takes the entire world in stride. Regardless, every moment I spent with you is a moment worth remembering, because you are worth remembering. I think that your love language to me is just being an intentional menace. No proper greetings, or chocolates. Just full-time mischief. Sending voice-notes playing random rap songs in the middle of my rants with absolutely zero context. Making a stupid joke when I come to visit you and Sara during lunch breaks. Teasing me to no end that my eyes hurt from rolling them so hard. Stubbornly showing up in all the tiny, annoying, unforgettable ways. Because your love is not quiet or relentless. It's chaotic. It's the daily decision you make to be my most consistent irritation. Like moss on a rock. Like glitter you can't shake off. But under all that noise, I know you still have affection for me, like Gru has for his minions (not that I'm your minion, I would never be a minion to a man). And all I want to say to you, my dearest friend, is that I wish to grow old with you. I wish to witness every gentle change time brings - the lines around our eyes from years of laughter, the stories we'll retell countless times, each memory becoming richer and softer with age. I wish to sit beside you, decades from now, still finding joy in simple moments, still leaning on each other through whatever life has left to show us. I wish for us to carry the closeness we share now into our quiet years, a friendship that's weathered storms, celebrated triumphs, and softened losses. To one day look back and realise we've lived fully - not just because of the adventures we've shared, but because we stayed side by side, accepting one another through every version of who we've become. I wish to grow old with you, knowing that friendship like ours is rare and precious. Because at the end of this journey, when everything else fades and changes, I hope we'll still be there, grateful we never let go. <br><br>
Thank you for being one of the most magnificent humans I came across because I am certain I'll probably never meet someone like you again. You will be a beautiful lesson that I'm glad I learnt. Somehow you seem to hold all the love that exists in the universe, in the palm of your hands - sprinkling it on the people you adore. You have so much love to give it is baffling how a single human being can store so much love inside of them. Perhaps it's true that they can, because you exist and you're full of it. And how lucky am I to have been a part of it. They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I think it's definitely applicable to you. In the near future, in the quiet corners of my heart, memories of you will linger like faded whispers.
<br><br>
Forever + always,<br>
Yana ❤︎
