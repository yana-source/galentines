    <h1>To my Valentine 💌</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        Happy Valentine's Day! 
        Through these past 2 years, you've been with me through all my ups and downs, whether I was being cheered on, or doing something embarassing, you've always had my back. Your presence in my life matters so much to me, more than you could ever think of. And I know I'm not very verbal with expressing my thoughts and feelings, so I thought the best way to show you my appreciation and love through what I know best - being a nerd. So I made this entire website to show you how much I appreciate you. And I know the probability of me getting an actual Valentine is far off in the future, but atleast I have the coolest homegirls I could ask for (yes, including the boys, you are now my homegirls). They say you're a mosaic of everyone you've met, and I think it's safe to say you are a big tessera of that mosaic. This short time we've spent together is the only reason I could still bring myself to come to school when things were hard. Although I know we'll soon be parting ways, I never ever want to forget you; you've made a massive impact on my life and I'll cherish you forever. Love you (that's the only time I'll be saying this).
