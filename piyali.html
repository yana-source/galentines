    <h2>Dear Piyali,</h2>

    <p>
    I remember the first time I met you. We just got admitted into this school. You and your dad were in line before me at the office, and my dad asked you for your name and where you stay. Later, I asked my dad why he spoke to you. Did he recognise you or your dad? He replied he did it so that I would make new friends. That was one of the best decisions he'd ever made. I couldn't sleep before the first day of school. As you know, I get really anxious, and I wasn't able to rest for a bit. With zero hours of sleep, I came to school, unsure and nervous. I had no clue who to talk to, where to go, what to do. After finally navigating the long and winding corridors and hallways, I reached the classroom. I had no idea who to sit with. Then I saw you - sitting alone. I quickly ran over and placed my bag next to yours. I wasn't sure if that was the right thing to do. But I didn't have anyone else. The hours of not sleeping finally caught onto me and I lolled my head on the desk. Just then, Cynthia Ma'am came in for her first History class, and you shook my shoulders to wake me up. And just the other day, you were pestering me to wear my stockings before my dad arrived. It's like it was destined for you to become my mom-friend.<br><br>
Words are not enough to express how grateful I am to have met you in this life. I know our friendship started in the most unlikely way, and I will forever be grateful for that moment. After the first day of school ended, I walked downhill to the gate, where you were waiting. I didn't expect to see you there. You said you were waiting for someone to walk with, and while I wanted to be alone, I took it as an opportunity to build a friendship. I remember buying a packet of chips and asked you if you wanted one. You said no, but I bought you one anyway. You walked ahead of me, and waited for me while I caught my breath. We didn't talk much, and when I reached my house, we parted ways. Later, I found out you knew me from before and thought I was a bitch. How did you even have the energy to be so nice to me? I guess we'll never know. Since tomorrow is only borrowed time that is not promised to any of us, keep these words deep in your heart, so you never have to question who you are to me. You've seen me through very season of my life in this school - when I had a falling out with Shrishti, when the anonymous school confession page spread rumours about me, when I had drama with Ametei and the others, when I couldn't tolerate school - and you are still here, weathering every storm alongside me as though it's our storm. We've had some bad moments too - when I got angry at you for hiding your secret boyfriend from me, or when I would irritate you to no end. And yet we feel our way through the dark, wearing our hearts like the only compass we know, and always finding the light no matter what. You are my 'no matter what'. I cross my heart when I say: you are my pinky promise, my secret keeper, my endless laughter, sister of my soul. You are proof that not all promises break, not everyone leaves, and forever is possible. You are my four leaf clover, my saving grace, the one shoulder that never got tired no matter how much I rested my head upon it. You are the spine made of steel, wings that never make me fall. You, with your thousands of memes (oh, how I'll remember the memes we shared during our class 11 finals), your silly humour, and every dry and inappropriate joke I've used to try and get a reaction out of you. We've laughed until we cried and I've cried till you made me laugh and I swear, I have all of that laughter bottled up deep in my soul. I save it for a rainy day. I save it for the dark. I save it to save me and it always works. You are my lucky charm, my favourite song, the better part of me. You are my biggest fan, always cheering the loudest, giving a standing ovation even when I'm losing. You are my hope when I thought I lost it, my spirit when I crushed it, my heart when I broke it. Thank you for always seeing me, getting me, hearing me, knowing me. It never went unnoticed. I'll always be by your side, and hopefully you'll always be by mine. Every exam, every project, every debate, every lunch break, every viva. You'll always be the Roll No. 14 to my Roll No. 15. I don't think there are enough words to describe how much you mean to me, and I've exhausted my capacity in trying. I never realised how much you felt like home to me until I found myself thinking about how much I wish you were with me, thinking about how I want to experience every adventure of life I go through with you by my side. The saying "home is whenever I'm with you" has never been more clear to me. You are my home and I am homesick without you. I hope we're together in every universe. It doesn't matter who we are in every universe, at least we're together.<br><br>
Sometimes in life, you find a special friend. Someone who changes your life just by being part of it. Someone who makes you laugh until you can't stop. Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in the world. Someone who convinces you that that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. If you turn and walk away, your forever friend follows. If you lose your way, your forever friend guides you. And if you find such a friend, you feel happy and complete because you need not worry. You are my forever friend.
<br><br>
Forever + always,<br>
