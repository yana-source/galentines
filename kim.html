    <h2>Dear Kim,</h2>

    <p>
    My earliest memory of you was when we were in kindergarten. You and I were in different sections. One day, I was wandering down the hallway right before assembly, and reached your classroom. I remember you standing there with Syesha Jyrwa, Naki and a few other people. I was immediately intimidated. You spoke to me for a while, and one thing I remember you saying was "Both our names are Syesha," while pointing at yourself and Jyrwa. And now, fourteen years later, I am no longer intimidated, but incredibly fond of you and our friendship. <br><br>
Thank you for coming into my life. You've shaped me in such a way that is unchangeable.  Thank you for changing the direction of my existence towards something better. I remember when we both first joined this school, we weren't incredibly close to each other, and mostly spoke when you were still with Ruth (ew), and I was close friends with her because she would give me a ride home everyday. I remember going up to your room once. I remember meeting your dog. I remember talking about Outer Banks during parties. I remember filming that North Korea × China video during Christmas. I remember the small moments we spent together even if there weren't many. After joining this school, we became so much more closer and I couldn't be happier about it. I remember when you were best friends with Gaayatri and I was best friends with Shrishti when we were still in that friend group, and I remember how we both got betrayed by them, but we never spoke much about it to each other because we were (or rather, are) the type of people who rarely open up. I remember when you had a thing with Ashutosh (another ew) and I tried to snap you out of it, but to no avail, because I was terrible at communicating. I remember feeling slightly awkward whenever it was just the two of us because I had no clue what to talk to you about. I remember the late night rants, bitching about Zarine during her classes, laughing at the 'nugget man', having intense discussions about movies and books and shows, randomly lore dropping and trauma dropping out of nowhere, teaching you how to be the perfect Prince Charming for the skit, getting drunk together, and every other moment we shared. Man, will I miss these times. I don't think I'll ever get over the amazing times we shared together when I'm in college, because you are a one-of-a-kind person, and no one can ever replace you. My heart could be just as ever-changing as anything else, but my love for you will always remain. Loving you has become a part of myself; it's impossible not to think of you when there are pieces of you imprinted so dee in me; I see you everywhere in everything that reminds me of you. In random movies, "Kim would probably love watching this," or seeing a camera store when I'm out, "Kim would go crazy seeing this." Everything you do means a lot to me, it holds more weight than you might ever realise. The way you soften your voice when you speak to someone even if you're fuming, as if you know their heart can't handle anything harsher, the way how you ask how I've been, even when I seem to look perfectly fine. Perhaps you do these things without even realising it, like a lighthouse guiding ships without knowing the impact of its light, and I know people often tell me not to hold onto moments like these, but I do. I treasure every bit of light you've given me, they are like stars scattered across a night sky, small but full of meaning. I would say I love you like nothing else, but that's not true. I love you like I love everything. I love you with all the passion you have put into everything you do, whether it's a random History project or a football game. I love you like a pair of calloused hands from years of work. I love you like I love tiramisu and ramen, my polished nails, or Christopher Nolan films. I love you like my favourite mango tea in the early morning and the sunlight filtering through the trees outside. I love everything the way I love you.<br><br>
And I know we will no longer see each other the way we used to, but remember, I will love you from here and anywhere I am, while you are elsewhere. As the blossoms and leaves fall, as the world is blanketed by white, as rivulets of its remnants trickle down and flowers bloom from the cracks of the earth, I will love you still. Time will pass, and the distance between us remains, and this love will stay. You are the Sarah to my Kie, and as JJ Maybank once said, "I already have everything I've ever wanted."
<br><br>
Forever + always,<br>
Yana ❤︎
