  <h2>Dear Shrishti,</h2>
  
  <p>
    Where do I even begin? The first time I met you (I don't even remember when), everything seemed so much more beautiful. Everything is blooming and colourful all around you, like flowers blooming in a garden full of happiness. The birds sang more softly as the wind blew, soothing the heart more than usual. It was like the world seemed to pause just to make way for your charm. The light of goodness that you always carry soothes the world around you, like the morning sunlight that drives out the cold. The look in your eyes is tender, erasing all doubts. <br><br>
I remember how we became the best of friends over a seating arrangement. I remember how we fell apart over a stupid boy. And I remember everything else in between, and after that. How could I not? It was like my life started the day you entered it. I still remember how lonely it was to rule my days before your presence coloured every corner of my life. The nights passed quietly, filled only with the lonely shadows that follow. But since you came, I no longer felt alone. Your presence, your smile, your voice and your touch brought a new light through the darkness of the night. Now that I am back to the first stage, I find myself regretting everything that went down between us. I remember on my first day of school: you hadn't arrived yet. I remember someone trying to sit in one of the seats, when Jon said that the place was reserved for you. I remember thinking, "Who is this special person who gets reserved seats before even joining school?" And then you came. And what a whirlwind you were. Wrapped in chaos, rascality, mischief and a devilish smile with a twinkle in your eyes that would evolve into a loud snort if you found something extremely funny. The truth is, you were an unexpected surprise. The defining moment. The collision of stars that slammed into me hard and sent my not-so-neat little world plummeting into the ocean. I never expected it to be you, of all people, to have such a deep connection with. Sitting with you during Geography classes when we weren't permitted to change places, bunking every History class known to existence, communicating with each other on our textbooks when we finally had a History substitute, all the inside jokes, the running quip that the chemicals from straightening my hair had fried my brain into doing the most daring shit, texting each other every minute of the day with the most random updates, doing detective work on anyone we found slightly interesting, you daring me to tell a boy he looks cute, me daring you to spill all your lore, random calls in the evening, all these memories may fade away, but they have made an immeasurable impact on my life. Being able to find someone you click with so naturally is the best feeling ever. You feel like you've been best friends your whole life, it feels like coming home. I remember when we first stopped talking, life was like a void. I so desperately wanted to talk to you, hear your voice again, and just laugh with you like we usually did. But I thought I was doing this for my own good (which I had rarely done before, and had little experiencing of knowing what the fuck to do), and decided to keep to myself. Everyday felt empty. Life had no meaning anymore. My only best friend I'd made (and had somehow an even closer connection than I had with, say, Leonie), and I'd decided to push her away. And when we finally stopped talking, that was the day that I think I would consider the worst from my entire life in this school. I remember spending my days crying because of how conflicted I was with my feelings. Raahi had even tried convincing me on multiple occasions to sort things rather then let it rot and our friendship fade. But I thought we would be better apart because I was still a mess and you didn't need to be dragged into it. That's how much you meant to me. I've never really had close friendships since then, I always felt apathetic towards people, even after trying. Fun fact about me, and I've never told this to anyone else, but I had a knack for poetry (since people thought I have good writing skills). And you were exactly the poem I wanted to write. The world would know how enthusiastic I was, saying your name, your name, and only your name when my fingers were at work. Landing on a quiet canvas that hasn't been filled with anything, so I started to think that what I wanted to write about was you. Your not-so-soft spoken, charming face, and your gentle yet at the same time hazardous treatment; everything can't disappear from my mind, not even for a second. The way your eyes shut and you lean back and let out a hearty laugh, the way you clap right before you laugh, the mischievous twinkle in your eyes when you have a secret to share, the mole on your top lip, your thick hair tied in a high ponytail with your bangs let out, your big Tim Burton-esque eyes and your extremely expressive face. They say that the greatest love stories are not romantic, and I think it's safe to say that <strong>you </strong>are my greatest love story. They also say that the best friendships don't have any pictures together, and I think that applies to us, because I couldn't find a picture of the two of us to save my life (hence this extremely random and fugly ass picture, sorry about that). I think I wished for you all my life. If past lives are real, I believe that we were best friends there too, where death was the only thing that could separate us. If parallel universes exist, I am certain that we were two intertwined souls searching for one another in every corner of the world. In this lifetime too, I sent my hopes to the stars, hoping that I was destined to find my platonic soulmate. Then you appeared, and it felt like all my whispered wishes had finally found my way back home. When we got assigned our English project on King Tut, I desperately wished I wouldn't be in the same group as you. I had my fingers crossed under the table and everything (dramatic, I know). And when it was announced that we were, after all, going to be in the same group, I cursed the universe. I am extremely bad at social situations and did not have the slightest clue on how to approach this...mess. Then Piyali and Raahi told me that maybe it's a sign for a new beginning and I should let go of the past. I considered it. So, one day during History class, when you were sitting in the front with Piyali, and I was sitting right behind you with Timothy, I forced myself to talk to you regarding our presentation, and when I finally did and you turned away, I completely crashed out over Timothy. I grabbed him by the collar and shook him violently because I didn't know how to process that interaction. He was very visibly shocked and annoyed. But maybe Sabatini was playing her cards right because I could not be more grateful that a stupid English presentation brought you back into my life. When we were as close as close could be, I felt more alive when I was with you, and I rarely, if never, felt that way with anyone before. You lit up the fire in my heart, you gave it sparks. Because when I was with you, I was in my sanctuary. When I was with you, I felt like myself. You weren't just holding my hand, you were holding my entire body and soul, and it felt so harm, like the heat of a bonfire in the middle of winter. Every time I needed someone to listen to me, your face would show up in my mind. Every time I needed someone to embrace me with pure warmth, your hold would wrap my entire body (hypothetically, because I don't do physical touch). Everything about you felt like a river, flowing peacefully. Your mere name in my head was possible in calming me down when I was anxious. When I was in Bangalore and we would keep in touch everyday, I remember my aunt asking, "Why are you <strong>always</strong> on the phone with her?" but there was no one else, there was only you. I remember that we were on call once, I was sitting in my cousin's bunk bed (on the top bunk, obviously), looking out the window at the vast city night life below me, toying with the hem of my pants. That was the first time I told you 'I love you'. In fact, I think that was the only time I told I love you to a friend ever. And just then, my cousin decided to choke on her food so I had to go run and help her. I remember when I visited your place for the first time. It was the 15th of August,2024. It was a bright and sunny day which soon turned grey and rainy, and Zohar was guiding Sanskriti, Shourik and I to your place. I remember reaching there soaked, still in my uniform. I remember laying down on the carpet with everyone and chilling. I remember sitting with cups of Coke in our hands talking about anything and everything. I remember eating rajma chawal. I remember your dad dropping me off, and me not being able to give him the right directions. I remember you telling me the next day that your dad described me as 'dishahari'. I also remember the 16th of August, 2024. You had invited me over to watch Stree 2. I remember how stupid the film was, and the review I gave it on Letterboxd was exactly "Peak shitpost cinema", with a rating of 2 stars. I think I've mentioned the twinkle in your eyes many times, but they are a crucial aspect. I used to remember your eyes by heart. They are big eyes, framed with long lashes, they were a deep brown shade, sort of like the earth right after a gentle shower. I think they have specks of an even deeper brown in them, but I'm not sure. The memory of you has seemed to have faded. But I remember how I used to think about your starry eyes and how they shifted my mind away from all the pain I'd been harbouring. I loved seeing the sparks in them when you spoke about something that lights up your heart. It's honestly funny how I saw stars scattered in your eyes, as if your irises evoke something so bright that captivated me and made me want to focus solely on you in those moments. I wonder if this happens only when you speak of things you love and I also wondered, after we fell apart, if I could ever recover from my cosmos of your eyes? So I waited, until the memory of you no longer hurt, just you in stillness, and I could gaze into your eyes anew. Yet, I still saw stars resting there, but this time, they didn't evoke the feelings that made me want to dance around the kitchen. Instead, I only felt content. Maybe this was the way we were meant to be. Close for a short time, cheering each other on from afar for the rest. They say someone's eyes speak volumes about what's in their heart, and I often felt happiness from seeing your eyes, so, I hope your heart is filled with beautiful things that will make your starry eyes sparkle and glitter once again. <br><br>
I never thought that love could so profoundly affect a person's life. However, with you, I learned that love is a force capable of changing everything. With you, I learned to see life with more beautiful eyes and a bolder heart. And maybe this did happen for the better. I see you happier now, with people of your own environment. Thank you for coming into my life. You are every dream about friendship I've had come true. Thank you for making me feel so lucky, even if it was for a short while. And although the distance between us may grow along with our emotional proximity, I'll never forget this adventure we had. Happy Valentine's Day, Shrishti. I hope life treats you well.
<br><br>
Forever + always,<br>
Yana ❤︎
