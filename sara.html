  <h2>Dear Sara,</h2>
  
  <p>
    The first time I met you, you were in your lab coat. I was downstairs, near the computer lab, right by the pillar. I was speaking to Nanglam, and you were there too. You tried to converse with me, and I remember feeling shy because we were both still new to this school. I don't know how or why the universe decided we needed to meet, why it decided we needed to know each other this well, why it was then, why we became so close so quickly, why we know so much about each other, why we have so much trust in each other, but the universe knew I needed you, it knew I needed someone to talk to when no one else understood, it knew we were meant to be friends. I don't know why we were destined to meet or why we are destined to love, but we are. <br><br>
Having you in my life has been one of my greatest privileges. You are golden, I hope you know that. You are such a great person who makes me feel so lucky to call you my friend, and you deserve the world. Walking back home from school with you, roaming around during school linking arms, bringing food for you during lunch breaks, these may seem like small moments, but it's what made our friendship so wonderful. When I was going through a hard time because of friendships, I felt safe enough to confide in you, and the way you simply listened without judgement, it felt like finding the place I really wanted and needed - a place where everything feels right. Since then, I've grown to admire you and think about everything you've faced with such determination. Even when dark clouds gather, you still shine like a star, radiating light in the night's darkness. You are proof that unconditional love exists. Thank you for coming into my life. Thank you for changing the direction of my existence towards something better. You've allowed me to grow in many ways that I didn't know were possible. I thought that I had things figured out, I thought that the flow of my current life was as smooth as could be. But you came and everything became crystal clear. I realised that I could become an even better version of myself. I accepted my imperfections and understood what it means to let growth in, to let lessons teach you things, to let love in. I valued my dreams more and became determined in ways I never thought possible. I became more whole in myself than I've ever been before. And I know that it's down to me - the hard work, the hours I put in, the way I treat people, the value that I give myself. But still, I thank you because you brought to light this side of me. I thank you because you pushed me to test my limits. I thank you because you want to see me reach the heights that I see for myself. I want to thank you, because you're kind, funny and selfless. I want to thank you, because you're one of my best friends. I want to thank you, because I didn't know how much impact another person could have on your life until I met you. I want to thank you, because you really are something special. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become friends with me, but I couldn't be happier about it. Just spending time with you instantly lifted my mood. Your cute face, sweet smile, cheeky laugh, it just instantly made my day better. Loving you is like a leaf falling in autumn. Loving you made me know the reason for where I should go, to find my lost soul from being swallowed up by the misguided streets. I love you without limits, I love you because you deserve to be loved, in a way where I will never fail to do it, making the tide sea dance, celebrating you. Loving you is like a light that always touches my soul, never ceasing to shine so that I can give you my feelings. I will forever cherish every gift you've given me, whether it was a Christmas card, or a birthday gift. I will never forget your selflessness, your kindness, and your soft-spoken personality. Every moment with you feels like soaring among the clouds, free and weightless.<br><br>
Loving you feels like loving the sky, boundless, expansive, and ever changing. Your presence envelops me like the vastness of the heavens, filling my heart with wonder and awe. Just as the sky holds the promise of infinite possibilities, loving you opens doors to endless discoveries. They say the sky is pretty when it is not a white or blue hue, but to me, the sky is always pretty, no matter what colour it offers. I see its beauty in every shade, just as I see yours in every season of life, and that's why I think loving you is akin to loving the sky. Happy Valentine's Day, Sara. You've made an immeasurable impact on my life in such a short amount of life. My love for you will never fade, even if it is subtle.
<br><br>
Always + forever,<br>
Yana ❤︎
