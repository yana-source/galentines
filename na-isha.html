    <h2>Dear Na-i,</h2>

    <p>
  Fourteen years ago we became friends, and ever since then, my life has been so much brighter and happier. Walking in as kids in Nursery, to walking out as adults done with high school, you have truly been there every step of the way. I don't think there are words that exist that would allow me to advocate for the hold you have on me. Meeting you was like listening to a song for the first time and knowing it would be my favourite. <br><br>
I am trying to recall how our friendship started and how it happened, but I don't know exactly how one day, we just became each other's company and friends. Admittedly, when you first joined this school, and when I found out we wee going to be in the same section, I was not looking forward to it. Not because I didn't like you, but because I just left that hellhole of a place and wanted a completely fresh start. Little did I know, having you back in my life would make such a vast difference. I remember when we were in the first or second grade, we were in the park and hanging upside down form the monkey ladder. You were way braver than me, and were using the bigger monkey ladder. You hung upside down from the top using your legs and all of a sudden, lost your grip and came crashing to the ground. I remember everyone running towards you. I remember you had to get braces afterwards. I remember when we were in the fifth grade and you started tying your hair in a high braid. Whenever we went to the playground, and I would ask you to do the 'helicopter', and you would spin your head around and make your braid whip (one of the funniest moments ever, in my opinion). I remember when we were in the eighth grade, and I called you spontaneously over for my birthday, and you still came along with Ametei when we literally had our maths exam the next week. I remember in the tenth grade how we both got chosen as prefects and we would talk about our classes as our 'kids'. I remember how we would go to Ms. War Nongbri's house to choreograph the drill for the sports day, and would eat mini cheesecakes and watch videos on her computer. I remember when you first got admitted into school. Ametei, I and the rest of the Ethics Bowl team were in a cafe and talking about you. I remember when you first joined school and I could barely meet you because I was in class only in rare occasions. I remember when we all formed a friend group, and what a disaster it became. I remember when we went on our first field trip in Mawlynnong. I remember when I <strong> accidentally </strong> choked you (I still feel terrible about that, by the way), and you cried the entire time. I remember when our houses went against each other in the football matches, and we got the first prize while your house won the second place. I remember when we both went against each other for the inter-house debate, and this time, your house won. I remember how we acted professional during the MUN so people didn't think you were trying to favour me. I remember all the laughter we shared in class, all the inside jokes, all the debates, ranting over men, spilling about crushes, everything. You have shifted my expectations, rewritten definitions and altered my vision through the introduction of new colours to see. Even when I believe I have reached the ceiling, somehow with you there is a persistent soft fall. We laugh like children together. You make experiencing this life brighter. When my inner child fears any harsh returns, you consistently soothe with reassurance and remind her. I like who I am when I am with you, how you see the world and how you carry yourself. You are so captivating that it baffles me how anyone ever fumbled you. You are a safe place, where the strident weather and unkind words cannot reach me. You have allowed love to be something to be enjoyed, no longer feared. I am in awe of the evolution of you, I feel blessed that out of all sights, I get you see you. You have grown into a beautiful and aspiring woman, and as long as I am alive, you will always have someone to be proud of you.<br><br>
Happy Valentine's Day, Na-i. I hope you grow up to be a kickass lawyer, and I hope one day you get to represent me in court (for legal reasons, this is a joke). It would take centuries to decipher the scroll of aspects about you that I adore, so in short, thank you for being everything you are. 
<br><br>
Forever + always,<br>
Yana ❤︎
