  <h2>Dear Gaayatri,</h2>
  
  <p>
    You changed my life in ways you couldn't imagine without even trying, and I don't think I could ever tell you how much you mean to me. I can't imagine what things will be like without you. A lot of things are about to change soon, we have to become adults and deal with the real world, and people are going to come and go, but I will always have your back. Thank you for being exactly who you are and for offering me a friendship I've wanted and needed my whole life.<br><br>
They say, sometimes in life, if you're lucky, you will meet people who just <strong>fit </strong>. People, who at first glance, you might not have thought you could have so much in common with - people you didn't know could become so important to you. People from different circles, different experiences, different places. But their souls just clicks with yours. It's hard to put into words because these people just make sense. It doesn't matter how different your lives were before you met. What matters is that you just fit. Your souls are made of the same thing and you understand each other. And what makes these connections so special is that it feels like finding family that you didn't know you had. It's finding peace and comfort and home in unexpected people. It's finding the people whose souls fit with yours. I think it's safe to conclude that your soul fits with mine. To be absolutely transparent, I have no clue of the time we first met. It's like we just got put into the same timeline besides each other and the universe said, "Here you go." And I couldn't be more glad for it. There was a tall, fair girl with brown locks of hair which would shine in the sun, who'd sit with me, carrying a bag with a jangling keychain on it. She told me she was from Pune. She told me she too, like me, came from a convent school. She told me her best friend's name was Nayantara, and she misses her dearly everyday. She told me her dad got transferred to Shillong the previous year, and she had visited it before coming to settle here permanently. She told me she was a big F1 fan. I could immediately tell I liked this girl. You were (or rather, are), like a ray of sunshine personified. Every time you laughed it was like the rain stopped and the clouds disappeared and the birds chirped louder and the sun shone brighter. I remember in the early stages of our friendship, when Zohar had a crush on you (I'm sorry for bringing this up), and you didn't like him back. When it was time for our field trip to Mawlynnong, I had to go collect everyone's permission slips. I remember going downstairs with Shrishti to collect the slips from the Science kids, and when I tried to collect Dominic's, but he refused, because he was selected as Zohar's wingman and wanted to switch places with him so Zohar could come on our trip instead. I remember chasing him down and giving him a good old verbal thrashing until he finally relented and handed me his permission slip. I also remember when Sarthak had a crush on you (I'm sorry for bringing this up too), and tried to win you over with his F1 rizz. It was hilarious. The times we shared in eleventh grade are honestly unforgettable, and I never want to forget it. Even when I'm old and probably diagnosed with dementia, I'll hire someone to remind me of the times we had together. I'll tattoo it on my back so it's forever etched in me. The times we spent together in the past year are even more unforgettable. Joining the Ethics Bowl team together, all the shenanigans we did instead of actually preparing for the competition, skipping classes in the name of 'student council' just to laze around the school, bunking classes to gossip in the library, coming to school on godforsaken Sundays, you bringing your mom's famous orange cake with lemon zest (which i <strong>adore</strong>). I will look fondly back on these memories in the years to come. Among all the choices I've learned in life, there are only a few that I never doubted - and one of them is choosing you. Every day, every second that passes, I'll choose you again, without a pause, without a doubt, in a moment, of a heart full of love. No matter how many stars shine in the night sky, no matter how many roads I take, one thing's for sure: I'll keep choosing you. I didn't feel like I could relate to a lot of people when it came to my mum, and while this is an extremely weird statement, I felt that our bond became slightly closer because we both had something to share with our moms: cancer and baking (what a morbid sentence, jeez). I also remember when I told you that I had a wet dream about Aryan (wow, I really have no shame for bringing this up) and you just accepted it without reacting as if I told you that the sun rises in the east. Nonetheless, these things that I once called hideous or weird have somehow transformed into the gems that I cherish the most. I remember when I forgot my book once, and started cursing myself under my breath. You heard it, and said "please don't talk to yourself like that." Before you, I often gazed upon my flaws, the little quirks and imperfections that made me feel like I was never enough. But then there you were, looking for perfect in every imperfection. You are like melted butter on toast, warm and cozy. Every word you say, how you carry yourself, is a melody that calms a soul and makes everyone want to be around you (which it evidently does, by the looks of it). When I listen to 'Heroes' by David Bowie, I promise to think of you, because of our shared love for The Perks of Being a Wallflower. You are the Patrick to my Charlie, and also the Knox to my Charlie (Damn it, the name is Nuwanda) and no matter the distance or the time, we will always have this linking us together. <br><br>
One day you'll meet a girl who will talk about the world as if she's lived a thousand lives and she'll see things in such a different perspective that you'll question everything you know. Don't let her go. Because she's probably one of the best friends you could ever make. Happy Valentine's Day, Gaayatri. I hope we are infinite in every moment.
<br><br>
Forever + always,<br>
Yana ❤︎
